This is also called a structural Directive. It is helpful to know that * is just a shorthand to explicitly defining the data bindings on a template tag. The template tag prevents the browser from reading or executing the code within it.

I've promised myself this time to enjoy not mourne over time lost.</p> Anyways, I was just thinking how many times i've fucked with Amazon, like everytime they come to deliver; I'm always not there, like everytime. I've given wrong phone numbers, i've given address wrong, yes! i've done that too and sometimes i've done both at once, like this time. I'm listening to Linkin Park right now, man, this band made a bonus track for Japan during tsunami. I don't think i have to say anymore of who they were. So good, man. I wasn't aware but when you look at them you know they were true, as true the truth can get. That's a bonus point in favor of them. Such a good man, I should try to be that good. If any aim there should be, it should be this. I should blindly follow his beliefs. It's nice to see this much mourning in the world right now, a man like that deserves that level of respect. Shit, I think I'm going to cry again. It's really good to see that he was a figure whom everyone is paying respect. People from all over the world, the whole rock genre, hollywood. You know you are legendary when people from every cast, religion, country, people who are rich, people who are poor, people you knew you, people who didn't knew, every fucking one mournes. They wrote a song about Earth, about what we are doing to it. There's no rock band I know of who has written anything about Mother Earth, ever! Why hasn't Greenday dedicated any song to Linkin Park as tribute yet? I'm waiting. Maybe they won't because of some understanding which come with that level and kind of maturity or they are just dicks in real life. I don't know Greenday from inside, man i should.",

It's nice because it's producing the final HTML in minified format. I just need a way to automate this process. I should look into the features of this editor. Maybe there's a way to convert the HTML into JSON&nbsp;somehow. That would be so easy for me then. Will have to write extra code for user layer for login, that would require me to study MongoDB. Well, let's see how this goes.</p><p>I got an idea, some implementation of adding notes to memories. Although it would require me to manually add them in data.json file which will be tiresome. We will see about that. I have decided to leave data.json to be my primary and quite frankly the only way to update/add memories. I just need to figure out AWS. It's so fucking confusing. I configured it to run blue/green deployment but my server where not stopping, even when I terminated them manually new servers kept popping up.</p>",
