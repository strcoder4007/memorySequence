        "content": "<p><em>As the clock struck</em> <em>mid-night</em> I was sitting snuggled deep into my blanket in an upright position at the corner of my room listening to Red Hot Chili Peppers. I came to know it was new year when I heard&nbsp;the celebration. I was feeling good, the feeling of new beginnings kept me in high spirits. I thought at last this could be my break from the surmounting guilt of lost passion, for this would be my year! I will get back to Competitive Programming and practice even harder than the second-half of 2015. I felt like making new year's resolutions, I usually didn't believed in new year's resolution or any type of resolution at all, because I had failed at them countless times before. But that night, as I said the soothing feelings of new beginnings had already swept me away, so I gave it another try. Needless to say I failed miserably but that comes way later in the story, will talk about that another time.</p><p>Among other new year's resolution one resolution was to document my life better, I felt there were way too many memories to hold in my head. I kept forgetting them if I didn't thought about them in a long time. That fact in actual seriousness is scientifically correct. I made a plan to document my life better, althought not knowing how to do it. My music history was being documented by last.fm which was one of the most important among the things to be documented. Another important thing to be documented was memories in the form of stories. This blog serves that purpose. I've named it <em>Memory Sequences</em> which is a term taken from the video game franchise <em>Assassin's Creed</em>. I started making this website on 21st July 2017 and I've documented the making process through out the week. That makes those blogs the first blogs on the website. Althought I will be posting memories before the inception of this website which makes these memories technically older than the first blogs on the website. I've decided to sort the blogs in chronological order. This blog will serve as the description of the purpose and origin of the website.</p><p>This website serves as a means to document my life better, therefore needless to say whatever content is posted on the website is meant to be read by <em>future me</em> and that means most of the gory details and secrets won't be excluded in the blogs. Although I have made this open so anyone interested can read this. Now the type of blogs I will be posting on this website; Actually it's pretty simple, I will be posting anything that is important to me or I'm grateful for, three things mainly-music, philosophical findings and memories. Other topics include skateboarding, books and computer science stuff.</p>",

        "title": "Rodney Mullen: The Godfather of Skateboarding",
        "content": "<p>There are legends in every craft, crafts in which legends are the ones closest to perfection. But only in rare possibility does it happen that the legend somehow ends up saving the craft from it's demise by evolving the craft itself and making it as big as to be considered a part of mankind's history. The photo below is of <em>Rodney Mullen, the man, the legend, the myth!</em> Do you know? This dude single-handedly invented 270+ skateboard tricks. Tricks from the most basic to impossible (there's even a trick named Impossible), many common modern skate tricks were invented by him, back in 1982. If you can do tricks on a skateboards it is most definite that those tricks were invented by him. He is still alive and well and visits world campionships as a special guest and judge.</p><img src = 'assets/img/big.jpg' width='100%'><p>He even has given a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GVO-MfIl1Q\" target=\"blank\">TED</a> talk. He talked about creativity in general and how he literally created freestyle skateboarding when it seemed skateboarding was taking it's final breaths in the early 1980s. He creatively brought skateboarding from parks and custom-made ramps to the streets. Even the shape of the skateboards was changed from flat to curve at both ends because he invented ollies and curved skateboards made it easier to do it. </p><p>There is much more he did for skateboarding than people know. The contribution which I consider the greatest and most radical was that he gave a platform, a craft to pursue for future skateboarders. He gave skateboarding a rebirth, skateboarding was now done on a totally different terrain and it was made possible by just an ollie! Ollie is when you push your backfoot such that the board jumps from the front while sliding the frontfoot from middle to the front end thus, lifting the whole skateboard. With the invention of ollie skateboards could now jump over curbs and other barriers. Then for easier ollies and it's variantions such as frontside shovit, backside shovit, kickflip, heelflip and other tricks which didn't used ollie such as pop shovit and primo slides, skateboards with curved ends became the mainstream. Afterall this was the skateboard which introduced a complete new dimension to skateboarding, the street!</p>",

        "title": "MS#3 Building the website: Wireframing?",
        "content": "<p>I was trying to embed spotify player in memories. It's a great idea. I should play with spotify and last.fm apis, there could easily be some features I don't know about. Well, I looked through their apis, nothing interesting to use on this website.</p><p>Listen to this song...</p><div class=\"col-md-6 col-sm-12\"><iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A6ppPNxdwG8A5Ed8DlNLV6I\" width=\"100%\" height=\"80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe></div><p>I accidentally listened to this when Spotify played this after <em>Iron Maiden's</em> playlist finished. Fell in love the moment I heard it. Althought in my experience the songs that I like in the first listen are the songs which seem to fade away quickly. </p><p>Anyways, I am using tinyMCE&nbsp;editor. It's nice because it's producing the final HTML in minified format. I just need a way to automate this process. I should look into the features of this editor. Maybe there's a way to convert the HTML into JSON&nbsp;somehow. That would be so easy for me then. Will have to write extra code for user layer for login, that would require me to study MongoDB. Well, let's see how this goes.</p><p>I got an idea, some implementation of adding notes to memories. Although it would require me to manually add them in data.json file which will be tiresome. We will see about that. I have decided to leave data.json to be my primary and quite frankly the only way to update/add memories. I just need to figure out AWS. It's so fucking confusing. I configured it to run blue/green deployment but my server where not stopping, even when I terminated them manually, new servers kept popping up!</p><p>And this is the reason why you should plan your project properly before starting it. I don't have continous integration or any server to put this project on or the final wireframe of the project. When they say that you should wireframe your project first, I hope they know that most probably there will be major changes to the project in the future. I should have wireframed properly eitherways. Now I need to shift everything from base component to a new component of itself such that I can summon it anywhere in the base component as a part of the it. And similarly make new components as a child of the base component. If I had thought about this earlier then it would have saved much of my time now. So, I guess wireframing is important even though you will have to change most of it in the end.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I don't know why people don't take time to explore music. Why do they allow themselves to feed off of <em>Billboard top 100</em>? Or what ever song is trending that week? You won't find influencial music <em>there?</em> The music that will guide you, inspire you, help you, challenge your mind with their clever lyrics and messages hidden between the lines, songs like these won't be present on <em>billboard.</em> Pop culture is death! It's one repetitive, brain-washing, uncreative and destructive genre of music.</p><p><em>\" Was I miserable that I listened to pop music or did listening to pop music made me miserable?\"</em> - Rob, High Fidelity.</p><p>I'm possessed by <em>Iron Maiden</em> well, you can basically say by the whole metal genre. Just found out that <em>Katatonia's</em> new album <em>Fall of the Hearts</em> is getting really good reviews.</p><div class=\"container-fluid col-md-8 col-sm-12\"><iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Aalbum%3A6LnvGIN1uE1RYJIGhNo9ay\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe></div><p>I mean I knew it would be worth listening to but this unpreceedented appreciation for the album I'm seeing online is awesome. They are saying that <em>Katatonia</em> has changed their music style for the better. They are more of a progressive metal band. Now Katatonia is blending doom metal and progressive metal. I'm actually really psyched for this genre change, it's like they just <em>progressed</em> towards progressive metal. As I am writing this I feel such an urge to listen to it right now. I mean it's doom + progressive, how could someone knowingly wait for something like that? I am saving the album for the winter. I know that's childish and doing that sometimes turns out to be a bad idea but, it's <em>Katatonia</em>, I'am not going to listen it in the summer.</p><p>When it's bleak outside and every thing is quite, still and cold that will be the time to play <em>Katatonia</em>. Or should I listen to it right now? It won't matter much, I will still be listening to it in the winter. Katatonia is capable enough to create that bleak atmosphere even on a sunny day. Just take <em>In the white</em> for a sample track. From the moment the song begins, right from the first beat the atmosphere around you changes into a bleaker, darker yet welcoming one. The guitars on the songs are just magnificient. This band is one of those bands who are good in every aspect. The guitar, the vocals, the lyrics, the style of delivery, the bass, the rythym and the drums.</p>",

        "title": "MS#4 Web App Update",
        "content": "<p>I want to write about the project as I don't have any strong feeling towards something or any other substancial thing to write about.I have been working on this project for 12 days now. I am happy with what I've built so far. Angular 4 is an awesome framework! It has made the webapp so modular and versatile that each component can co-exist with every other component and together they are forming different states which basically is one of the permutation states. The app seems to run fast and efficient as I don't have any additional modules and libraries lying around. Dead-code has been minimized although Angular 4's <em>tree-shaking</em> would <em>nail the coffin</em>. The aim was to be light-weight, there was no restrictions on the processing power or anything, I made it such, 'cause <em>why not</em>? Although according to <em>Chrome's</em> console the whole app takes 2.3 seconds to load, which is higher than expected. So, I tried running a new project generated via angular-cli and benchmark it. It was taking 1.6 seconds to load the complete seed project. According to that I guess my app is supposed to take 2.3 seconds. I think <em>Spotify</em> is delaying the app. I see the errors for every <em>Spotify</em> player embedded, in the console. Strangers on the Internet are saying that it's some <em>Google Chrome</em> SSL certificate permission termination error. The solution provided didn't worked.</p><p>The webapp is more or less completed, the only things left is the admin layer and search linking. I have found the solution as to how I can make this webapp public and at the same time use it the way I wanted. The idea is to add an admin layer such that all the memories with \"personal\" tag on them will only be shown to me. These personal memories will simply be excluded from the final public JSON object. I will code it tomorrow I guess. The next problem would be to rent a Virtual Private Server. I am afraid in using my Dad's card for paying on services which automatically charge you after your free subscription gets over. I am very lazy and careless at this. I need a company where it's paid monthly or completly free, although the later is hard to find. It just happened to me the other day, I rented a VPS from <em>Amazon</em> and it was fine and working, I even checked <em>blue/green deployment</em>, it all worked. After getting bored off playing with it, I went on to some other project. Four days later, I found, while I was messing with AWS I started four instances and all of them have been continuously since. The free(which is $1) limit was 750hrs and I was doing 940hrs.</p><p>Tomorrow I definitely will score a server. I hope Digital Ocean has <em>Continuous Integration</em>. If I am able to deploy it and pipe it to Github, I can automate the process of updating the content on the website.</p>",

So I'm going about it my way-right now just think about content which is neutral to everyone, we'll deal with the private/public thing later. I've decided to do a series on \"Interesting People\". There have been some people I have known (not personally) across all domains I'm interested in, whom I have found rather interesting. These people are not necessarily the best in what they do or the most famous in their domains, but there are qualities in each one of them that stand out. I find these people interesting because of two reasons. First, because while watching and really delving into what they did​ ​I had a moment when I was like, \"I too want to be like that\". And second, because these people contributed tremendously towards a good cause and didn't expect shit in return. You know what's more interesting? Even though these people come from domains which are completely different from one another, all these people b​​ehave, talk, understand and perceive the world exactly the same way. What's even more interesting is that these people despite having completely unrelated crafts in pursuit, all of them have the same goal! To have fun in exploring their craft.</p><p>Well, I'm gonna write about these people the best I can. This will be helpful in future, after all documenting my present thoughts is the goal of this website.</p>",

And that's why I consider myself unfortunate living here because all I am surrounded by are the people who are so full of bullshit that even the slightest of eye contact gets me into an ordeal. I am not saying that I am better than those people or anything, I don't consider myself any better when it comes to the big picture. Anyways, I really want to know why people do what they do. They are always brainstorming the best possible outcome of the conversation such that they can benefit from it. If they want something from you, they won't come at you directly, first, they will lay the foundation with their carefully thought-out bull-shittery and then they will slightly hint you about what they want. If you are as experienced as me, you could sense the underlying motive of the conversation right from the first sentence.</p><p>I don't hate people, I don't consider myself better than them and I don't consider myself an introvert so, why does the idea of talking to people seem like such a repulsive chore to me? A very boring and irritating chore to say the least. I can smell even the faintest of bull-shittery even from a mile away. I guess that's why I hate talking to people. I keep to myself and a small group of close friends. What's so polluting about the truth is the thing I can't seem to understand. Why it's so dauntingly repulsive that everyone's rather allowing themselves to feed off of other people's bull-shittery and in return feed them with their own?</p><p>\"<em>Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth.</em>\" ― Henry David Thoreau, Walden</p><p>I am sometimes so furious at the morals and values elders preached about, about what is the good and what is bad, about what should be the values one should have, about what life goals one should have, about what success(money) is, about how people through insane hard work achieved their goals and how I should try to do the same. It's all nothing but&nbsp;bullshit. They were all wrong. They allowed themselves to take in the bullshit that other people had so much of. Their brains were corrupted by the insane amount bullshit it had to deal with. They didn't allow themselves to think on their own. They never had a thought about, \"What if this predefined notion of how human lives should be, is nothing but a hoax?\" These people are not bad people, they are kind and humane, they just have shitty values and beliefs. I noticed a similarity between these elders I am talking about (or you can say the people in general), all of these people didn't achieve shit in their lives, they just kept talking about it, either how they were so close to achieving it or some excuse as to why they weren't able to. I don't believe in achieving but they did, and what happened, in the end, was all of them sitting and preaching thinking they have a lot of experience from life that they can bestow upon younglings.</p><p>\"<em>Behold, how the blind lead each other<br>the philosopher<br>you know so much about nothing at all&nbsp;</em>\" ― Death, The Philosopher</p><p>You see, bullshit doesn't come alone, it comes with all sorts of negative feelings such as jealousy, hate, greed, envy, self-loathing etc. How could you allow those unworthy emotions torment your brain when you could be focusing on doing what makes you happy? Giving time to the things that actually matter. People consider me an anti-social, an introvert, sometimes jerk and a show-off when they try to figure out my behavior towards them and that's good. I am fine with whatever makes them happy and get them off my back.</p>",

Next thing I know I find this news of Chester committing suicide 16hrs ago from LoudWire. Needless to say I spent the next few hours marathoning though their discography. That was the day I cried over someone's death for the first time. He didn't even knew me remotely but I cried because he influenced my life. <em>Linkin&nbsp;Park</em> was the first band I listened to. Their song&nbsp;<em>In the end&nbsp;</em>was the first English&nbsp;song I listened to. Many of my life-turning memories are soaked in their songs. They along with <em>Greenday</em>&nbsp;&amp;<em> Eminem&nbsp;</em>defined the time period from 2007-2013 in my life. Obviously they were important to me.</p><img src=\"http://images.dailyhive.com/20170721155903/chester-bennington-e1500678018162.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><p>I'm listening to them right now, this band made a bonus track for Japan during the tsunami. I don't think I need to say anymore of who they were. So simple yet good. I wasn't aware but when you look at them you know they were true, as true the truth can get. That's a bonus point in favor of them. Such a good man, I should try to be that good. If any aim there should be, it should be this. I should blindly follow his beliefs. Althought it's nice to see this much mourning in the world right now, a man like that deserves that level of respect. Shit!&nbsp;I think I'm going to cry again. It's really good to see that he was a figure whom everyone is paying respect. People from all over the world, the whole rock genre, hollywood. You know you are legendary when people from every cast, religion, country, people who are rich, people who are poor, people you knew you, people who didn't knew, every fucking one, mournes. They wrote a song about Earth, about what we are doing to it. There's no rock band I've known of, who wrote anything about Mother Earth, ever! Why hasn't <em>Greenday</em> dedicated any song to <em>Linkin Park</em> as tribute yet? I'm waiting. Maybe they won't because of some understanding which comes with that level and kind of maturity or they are just dicks in real life. I don't know <em>Greenday</em> from inside, man I should.</p>",

That cause could be defending a truth or  anyone's values, that cause could be futile, that cause could be valuable for the man ot that cause could be greed.

I accidentally played Katatonia(it's a band) and&nbsp;Katatonia being Katatonia, I just couldn't skip or stop&nbsp;it&nbsp;so I listened to all 23 songs,&nbsp;it reminded me of pols and after that&nbsp;Linkin Park&nbsp;started playing which reminded me of school. I stay clear of that amazing&nbsp;band for nostalgic reasons. Nostalgia is a seductive&nbsp;bitch. I haven't talked to some of you in months which is normal considering its me but it&nbsp;surely shouldn't be this way. There are songs and bands which remind me of each one of&nbsp;you whenever they get played. Ajit with Greenday more specifically Boulevard of broken dreams. Even thought we have spent&nbsp;shit ton of time together&nbsp;after class 10th but class 10th is what I remember vividly.&nbsp;Balveer with&nbsp;Miley Cyrus-we can't stop and not even the&nbsp;original one, we liked the cover Boyce Avenue made.&nbsp;Pols with half&nbsp;of my music library, he likes&nbsp;metal what can I say.&nbsp;Akash(<strong>IIT</strong>&nbsp;ISM Dhanbad) with Hanna Montana(in class 10th I asked him to download her discography, for some reason it just got&nbsp;stuck in my head).&nbsp;Shahi with Skillet,&nbsp;Maroon5 and nfs most wanted songs(remember&nbsp;Kota).&nbsp;Vasu with Eminem(class 12 last bench Eminem-The way I am, we even had lyrics hand-written on paper), I know I've thanked you several times already but really dude&nbsp;<strong>thanks</strong>&nbsp;for recommending Cradle of Filth.&nbsp;</p><p>This is getting touchy&nbsp;and in India people&nbsp;are not supposed to share there feelings but I know how you all are feeling&nbsp;at your new places. Not&nbsp;everyone gets an year back like me and be in the same place they were last year, well,&nbsp;except Vasu. Ajit with&nbsp;Hyderabad,&nbsp;Balveer and pols with&nbsp;Delhi, shahi with I don't know where, actually reply what's up with your life, I don't know shit about you anymore,&nbsp;Akash(<strong>IIT</strong>&nbsp;ISM Dhanbad) with Pune, I know you got a nice job and all but when you told me about your job&nbsp;schedule I was straight-out depressed, actually same with Ajit and Balveer(his is the craziest, even Saturday and Sunday too)&nbsp;too,&nbsp;Vasu same place and Siddhant still leeching off of his parents in Delhi doing nothing.</p><p>Man I've written a&nbsp;shit ton&nbsp;but still no sleep whatsoever. I want to meet you people but I'm so lazy that I haven't even&nbsp;met Siddhant who lives 1.5 hrs away&nbsp;from me, l've kept postponing for almost&nbsp;a year now. According to my level of laziness I won't ever meet Akash(<strong>IIT</strong>&nbsp;ISM Dhanbad)(now&nbsp;Pune)&nbsp;again&nbsp;as his family even shifted from gkp&nbsp;to Varanasi.</p><p>I don't know when will I meet Shahi,&nbsp;Vasu and Akash(<strong>IIT</strong>&nbsp;ISM Dhanbad) but I swear this week I will go visit Balveer, pols and Siddhant (actually I have to get my laptop battery replaced).&nbsp;And as per you&nbsp;Ajit I just don't worry about meeting you, I don't know why, we will be fine. Yeah,&nbsp;now&nbsp;this seems like a good ending. I swear next time you all get this type of mail, it will be a&nbsp;suicide note cause who uses paper anymore, it's 2017!</p>",

        "content": "<p>Memory Sequences is almost complete, one more day might do it. I am currently well-versed in Angular4 + Typescript and I have 3 more web apps to make using this framework which is good but I want to make apps using GoLang&nbsp;and Ionic Framework as well. I am thinking of giving ReactJs a run too. People are saying it's light-weight and easy to learn. It's going head-to-head against Angular4, it has to be good. But then I also want to explore&nbsp;C++'s development side by making a project. And if I'm doing C++ then I might as well make games. That would check another thing off the bucket-list. Although&nbsp;I want to get in machine learning too, I've never paid much attention to it in the past but it seems that's where the future's headed. That makes 5 completely(more or less) new domains to be learned by me in the next 9 months. It would feel overwhelming if I make a schedule to do all these projects. Schedules never work with me any ways. I'm not going to stress over completing all of these but right now I want to do something new and that's why I need to decide on something soon.</p><p>\"<em><strong>Hofstadter's Law:</strong> It always takes longer than you expect, <br />even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law</em>.\"&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Douglas Hofstadter</p><p>It is probable that I won't complete all of these in time so, I have decided to divide them on the basis of urgency of the projects a&nbsp;short-term goal and a long-term goal. Skills in short-term goal are those which I need for mediocre jobs most probably in a start-up, keeping myself on the forefront of technology will help here. For completing short-term goals I think I should continue doing web dev and try learning the obscure parts such as RxJs, ReactJs, make software I need to automate my life thus, encouraging my sloth behavior and eventually taking me to the next level of laziness. Similarly for long-term goal I.e aiming for a job in really good startup most probably abroad. Getting sponsored for a visa is getting harder, although it's relatively easier for developers. Some European countries have a special job skills which a migrant can have, fortunately, software engineering related skills are the ones most in demand. For these startups and companies, I will require having a wider knowledge in computer science. I come from an algorithm(C++) background so I can say a huge &amp; a fairly difficult part is already covered. Game development in C++ would teach me the other side of the language the Object Oriented Programming side. I need to learn machine learning as well. It seems really fun. Actually, I don't know shit about machine learning, I ain't got anything else to write about it other than that the projects are in a different dimension and I really want to try it. I think all this would enstate me as a programmer with fairly balanced knowledge in computer science. According to me, becoming a <em>jack of all trades and master of none </em>seems fruitful in software development!</p><p>I was of bored of programming so I decided to think and write about the technologies I should learn next. Making plans is so stupid but I still did it. Just like millions times before this plan will also fail, I will complete them if they stay fun otherwise I would give up, I'm not going to stress over them. Actually you can't call this a full-fledged plan. There's a deadline but I won't care much if I crossed it and I haven't even decided the order of the project. I just wanted to layout my interests and decide which one to do first.</p>",

        "content": "<p>This past week my writing has been to a minimum. I don't exactly know why. Is it because of the website? Because I am not comfortable enough with the security of my personal blogs? Or is it because writing on a keyboard hasn't yet made itself completely familiar to me? Most probably it's nothing, it was like this because I didn't make the personal filter and because of that storing the data was time-takingly painful. I am again headed to the place where I was headed back in May. The funny thing is that it made the <em>new me</em> (I know these words have a touch of naiveness and are filled with ego but I can't think of any replacement right now) scared for a moment. I think much more is going on than I know, psychologically speaking. Fuck this! I'm not gonna care if these logs are poorly written.</p><p>I should get in a habit of writing my thoughts down before they fly away, I tell you, some of them are amazingly profound that in some sense I know immediately that I won't reach this conclusion ever again in my life, this should be written right now and here! I think my behavior is changing to <em>Hunter S. Thompson's</em>. I am really interested to know more about him as I find him someone that has been to places only few have treaded to. Therefore he would have the answers to my questions. I thought I was done with questions and that's why it's really important to keep in mind that I gave up on trying, I didn't gave up on my interests. It's just a phase I guess, you know, the immitation you do when you are completely polarized by someone. Although I won't mind if I started living on his principles and acting the way he did. Actually that's what I want, this is the first time I've found a balance between programming and drugs. A balance which still needs improvement but a working one nonetheless. Living on Hunter S. Thompson's principles would actually make me better at my craft. He is one of the <em>interesting people</em> I will write about soon. I just realized the title of this blog is \"Life Update\" and I haven't written shit on it yet. Programming is going slow these days. I am not able to write enough code these days because this weed is making me such a sloth. I don't feel like programming because of it. Even the aim of the day is not a lucrative one&mdash;<em>fix the login layer and try to find a way to map tags to searched string</em>. I want something more interesting than this. Actually these objectives mark the end of the project. I guess what's going on is my ignorance towards <em>almost</em> completed jobs. I do this when the job is more or less completed (but still incomplete) to the point where it can be practically said that it's completed. There's a model which is up and running in all it's glory but the luxury features are pending. The problem with this is that I leave the job incomplete and when I need them in future to show or use it in another project, I will have to complete it, but by then the technology in which it's written would have already aged like a motherfucker and I won't have any choice other than setting the project aside. I don't care much if I set myself straight but I recommend I should, it will save a lot of time in the future. I should start something hard. Game programming I guess. I want to be sober now. I want my brain to function normally. I want to feel the high of making new shit, music and writing. I need to get out of this room more frequently. College could be an option, there's food too. Well, it's only 4hrs, it can be done.</p><p>I need to write about the whole giving up thing. After I gave up pretty much everything inside my head changed. I keep thinking about a topic to write about, a topic which I have already written in the notebooks. But, whatever's there in the notebook is pre-giving up. So most of the things I wrote are the things I don't believe in now. I guess I should exclude everything pre-giving up. But to think&mdash;\"not logging most of my mistakes could be a mistake\" is something I can't overlook. I guess I will be adding few older blogs here and there afterall!</p>",

        "content": "<p>The days are passing by so fast. It's already August. I don't know, whenever I get high, I feel like programming. These days programming is the only thing I am interested in. I am not attracted to music, movies, shows or youtube. I keep programming day and night because it's the only thing that keeps me from getting bored. It has sometimes felt a little too weird, I keep remembering Alan Wake video game in which the ghost was repulsive to light. So, many a time in the game&nbsp;we have to run to a light-post before the ghost gets us. In my&nbsp;case, the ghost is boredom and the light-post is programming. I am not sure if this weird habit of mine is improving me or not, but I'm sure programming a lot. Although I feel I am slow, which is easily predictive. I don't know how to feel about my situation. I am programming but my life is in complete disarray, I'm high all the time, I can't think straight, I can't read books, I don't feel like listening to music. I guess this has to end. I code when I'm not high as well. It's even more effective and efficient than now.</p><p>I'm not able to decide on what should I do with <em>time my show,&nbsp;</em>I have a new design in mind but that requires me to completely redo the whole design. And even then the website won't be responsive. I need to learn how to make custom responsive web sites. See, I am learning, don't think this all is just a waste of time. I need to learn passing values as services as well and storing the data in local storage.</p><p>Life is going the way I wanted it to, but still I'm not satisfied. I just wanted to float away and not mind the disturbance, and that's what's happening. But I am still not satisfied. Well, this conclusion was obvious, human's biggest dilema&mdash;never being satisfied applies to me as well. I can't outrun this. I am really confused as to how I should start in <em>real programming</em>. This phase is the slowest, most boring and undesirable one. The first phase, when the obvious path is yet to reveal itself. I've mailed both of my abroad contacts asking what should I do next. If they can help me anyhow, I will take it. I need to leave this place fast. I am an above-average developer in world perspective. I won't put myself in good-developer category but still above-average seems like a fine estimation. I have knowledge of algorithms and data structures, NodeJs/Angular development and some designing sense. I shouldn't find it difficult to find a good job. Actually I am not fretting the end of college, I am afraid of purposeless life after college. Right now I have time to do whatever comes to my mind but after college is over I won't have time to do shit. I won't have the whole day to myself, there will be restrictions. I will have to go to job every fucking day. You remember the internship days, right? It will be hell. I need to have a plan right now. Sometimes I think of freelancing but that's not satisfying work. Doing a job is the only choice I have, I guess, considering my laziness. So, if I am going to have a job I might as well do everything I can to soften the blow. I should really research what type of programming should I get into next. I need to improve as much as I can, it will increase the chances of me getting a better job.</p>",

        "content": "<p title=\"Fuck India\">Up until yesterday, I didn't ever think about how it would be like if I continue living in india and don't try getting out of this shit-hole after college. I always said I would leave this Country and never come back, but that was when leaving was a thing of the far-future. Believe me, it wasn't until yesterday that I felt the horror of what would my life be if I stay in this cum-dumpster. I came to think this when I had a talk with my uncle from Sweden yesterday. He told me that there's no way any company is going to sponsor a visa, as they sponsor only a very few elites from IITs. It's getting harder and harder to get a visa, therefore the only way for me to get out of this country is to do MS. But MS costs around ₹30,00,000 without a scholarship, which makes MS an absolute \"no\". In order to get a scholarship, I need to perform well in GRE (which is not a big problem) and also have decent grades in bachelors (which is the biggest problem). So scholarship is more or less out of the window. Being discouraged, I for the first time actually thought of living <em>here</em>.</p><p  title=\"All hail Norway!!\">I hate india, I hate everything it has to offer. It's full of shitty people and each and everything I like is frowned upon by them. I don't want to live in a place where I don't fit in. By this time I was hoping to find a silver lining to all this. Enter Norway, the best Country anyone could go to do MS! Norway has the best government, actually I don't have any political stance on any Country, I just consider Norway's government the best because all type of education provided in Norway is completely free! Schools and universities run on tax-payers money. Norway is the only hope for me right now. Living costs are high, but I could do a minimum wage job or something to cover that, it is allowed to work 20hrs/week for a student and full-time on holidays, or if it's still turning to be high I am ready to take a loan from my Dad or student loan from a bank. The only hiccup I found was to find an apartment. People are telling apartments are really hard to find but I am desperate enough to live anywhere. I am a little too low-maintenance, apartment is a non-issue.</p><p  title=\"Tru-kvlt\">I don't think fitting-in would be a problem. It would be easy to find people like me. After all some of the music I listen to originated from Norway. Many bands whom I listen to and like are from Norway&mdash;Satyricon, Dimmu Borgir, Mayhem, Emperor, Immortal, Darkthrone. They even have a sub-genre of metal named after them&mdash;Norwegian black metal. I don't need to tell you further on how much at-home I would feel there. You see it's bigger than music, the type of music I listen to, appeals only to people with certain mindsets&mdash;mindsets like mine, I am after those people. I can't wait to get out of this religion brainwashed country and go be a part of an actual culture that I like. I want to go home.</p><p><em>\"Mother North<br>United we stand (together we walk)<br>Phantom North<br>I'll be there when you hunt them down\"</em>&nbsp;&mdash;Satyricon, Mother North<br>(Mother North serves as somewhat of a black metal national anthem for Norway.)<br></p><p>You must be thinking how ignorant and arrogant prick I am. And it's my fault for making you think like that. Believe me, I am not one of those people who pick out mistakes in everything. My only problem is with this country, the people in this country to be specific. Other than that I live a pretty happy life! You can say that my only aim other than leaving this shit-hole is to wake up everyday and do EXACTLY what I want I like, do those things the whole day and go to sleep. And I am proud to say, I achieve my aim every single day! I am completey happy and satisfied with my life in solitude.</p>",

        "content":"<p>I was out on a trip to Mcleaodganj (2130m) which included a 9 km trek to Triund (2850m). I am not going to write about the details of the trip but about a weird thing I am feeling for 7-8 months now and how I found it harmless. The feeling's like I am watching and interacting with the world in 3rd person. Just peacfully floating away, relaxed all the time, spinning thoughts in my head completely secluded from the outside world. I was feeling like this when I was surrounded by nothing but trees, clouds and deafening silence. No rustling leaves no birds chirping. Like the forest was fast asleep in the cold night. This created the atmosphere I was longing for years. The bleakness was intense and I was enjoying solitude, but felt like I was experiencing it in 3rd person. It's like I can control the body and make it do things I won't do in <em>real life</em>, I am easily able to face my phobias without a hint of fear for I believe the body is not the real me, it's just a puppet, whatever happens it won't effect the state of mind I am presently deeply entrenched into, I am safe. I was knee deep in grass far away from any road in wilderness and I fear snakes! But I had no second thoughts when I had to cross several mountains and valleys. And because of that feeling I found myself sitting amidst the trees with clouds blurring the distant ones creating a bleak atmosphere yet feeling bad for not being able to absorb the atmosphere enough. Deviated by other thoughts, thoughts I had categorized as not qualified enough to give my precious time in solitude to.</p><p><strong>Sidenote: </strong>I need to take a solo trek, I want to be completely alone. If I was not lazy enough to make a bucket list, one thing I would certainly add would be to scream at the top of my voice for as long as I want and scream whatever words I feel like without being heard by anyone. For me it brings a feeling of absolute freedom.</p><p>I was convinced I was not thinking the things I should. The answer to this I came up with was to just let go, don't try. And finally when I was sitting on a mounted rock 8 ft tall, inclined towards the valley followed by the vast Dauladhar range in the morning waiting for sun to peek from behind the mountain as the invisible city beneath the clouds I couldn't see when I looked down at the clouds still lying in shade, I had a comforting conversation with the mountain in front of me. Like a reflection of the nature itself standing in front of me as I was asking for answers to my own nature from the lofty mountain. Why are humans so flawed? Why are we not pure like you? Should humans not be considered a part of nature anymore? For I want to be as silent as you, be as welcoming and even relentless as you, be around you more often. Was the old woman scaling the mountain, leaving her home for another 2 months for grazing someone elses cow after being only 3 days at home not happy? No, she was happy. It was her job, she was content with what she had. She accepted the fact that she is not strong like she used to be and now she jokes about how slow paced she was. These are the people I want to be around, people who actually know themselves and are satisfied with life.</p><p>I was wrong! This feeling of not being able to actually interact with the world had no effect on how I felt. The feeling were still there, true and pure.</p>",
