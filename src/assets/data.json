        "content": "<p>Yesterday I woke up to the moment I won't be forgetting. It was around 12 in the day when I woke up, I reached out for my laptop to do emails and &nbsp;<em>youtube</em>. Next thing I know I find this news of Chester committing suicide 16hrs ago from LoudWire. Needless to say I spent the next few hours marathoning though their discography. That was the day I cried over someone's death for the first time. He didn't even knew me remotely but I cried because he influenced my life. <em>Linkin&nbsp;Park</em> was the first band I listened to. Their song&nbsp;<em>In the end&nbsp;</em>was the first English&nbsp;song I listened to. Many of my life-turning memories are soaked in their songs. They along with <em>Greenday</em>&nbsp;&amp;<em> Eminem&nbsp;</em>defined the time period from 2007-2013 in my life. Obviously they were important to me.</p><img src=\"http://images.dailyhive.com/20170721155903/chester-bennington-e1500678018162.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><p>I'm listening to them right now, this band made a bonus track for Japan during the tsunami. I don't think I need to say anymore of who they were. So simple yet good. I wasn't aware but when you look at them you know they were true, as true the truth can get. That's a bonus point in favor of them. Such a good man, I should try to be that good. If any aim there should be, it should be this. I should blindly follow his beliefs. Althought it's nice to see this much mourning in the world right now, a man like that deserves that level of respect. Shit!&nbsp;I think I'm going to cry again. It's really good to see that he was a figure whom everyone is paying respect. People from all over the world, the whole rock genre, hollywood. You know you are legendary when people from every cast, religion, country, people who are rich, people who are poor, people you knew you, people who didn't knew, every fucking one, mournes. They wrote a song about Earth, about what we are doing to it. There's no rock band I've known of, who wrote anything about Mother Earth, ever! Why hasn't <em>Greenday</em> dedicated any song to <em>Linkin Park</em> as tribute yet? I'm waiting. Maybe they won't because of some understanding which comes with that level and kind of maturity or they are just dicks in real life. I don't know <em>Greenday</em> from inside, man i should.</p>",

        "content": "<p><em>As the clock struck</em> <em>mid-night</em> I was sitting snuggled deep into my blanket in an upright position at the corner of my room listening to Red Hot Chili Peppers. I came to know it was new year when I heard&nbsp;the celebration. I was feeling good, the feeling of new beginnings kept me in high spirits. I thought at last this could be my break from the surmounting guilt of lost passion, for this would be my year! I will get back to Competitive Programming and practice even harder than the second-half of 2015. I felt like making new year's resolutions, I usually didn't believed in new year's resolution or any type of resolution at all, because I had failed at them countless times before. But that night, as I said the soothing feelings of new beginnings had already swept me away, so I gave it another try. Needless to say I failed miserably but that comes way later in the story, will talk about that another time.</p><p>Among other new year's resolution one resolution was to document my life better, I felt there were way too many memories to hold in my head. I kept forgetting them if I didn't thought about them in a long time. That fact in actual seriousness is scientifically correct. I made a plan to document my life better, althought not knowing how to do it. My music history was being documented by last.fm which was one of the most important among the things to be documented. Another important thing to be documented was memories in the form of stories. This blog serves that purpose. I've named it <em>Memory Sequences</em> which is a term taken from the video game franchise <em>Assassin's Creed</em>. I started making this website on 21st July 2017 and I've documented the making process through out the week. That makes those blogs the first blogs on the website. Althought I will be posting memories before the inception of this website which makes these memories technically older than the first blogs on the website. I've decided to sort the blogs in chronological order. This blog will serve as the description of the purpose and origin of the website.</p><p>This website serves as a means to document my life better, therefore needless to say whatever content is posted on the website is meant to be read by <em>future me</em> and that means most of the gory details and secrets won't be excluded in the blogs. Although I have made this open so anyone interested can read this. Now the type of blogs I will be posting on this website; Actually it's pretty simple, I will be posting anything that is important to me or I'm grateful for, three things mainly-music, psychological findings and memories. Other topics include skateboarding, books and computer science stuff.</p>",

        "title": "The Godfather of Skateboarding",
        "content": "<p>There are legends in every craft, crafts in which legends are the ones closest to perfection. But only in rare possibility does it happen that the legend somehow ends up saving the craft from it's demise by evolving the craft itself and making it as big as to be considered a part of mankind's history. The photo below is of <em>Rodney Mullen, the man, the legend, the myth!</em> Do you know? This dude single-handedly invented 270+ skateboard tricks. Tricks from the most basic to impossible (there's even a trick named Impossible), many common modern skate tricks were invented by him, back in 1982. If you can do tricks on a skateboards it is most definite that those tricks were invented by him. He is still alive and well and visits world campionships as a special guest and judge.</p><img src = 'assets/img/big.jpg' width='100%'><p>He even has given a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GVO-MfIl1Q\" target=\"blank\">TED</a> talk. He talked about creativity in general and how he literally created freestyle skateboarding when it seemed skateboarding was taking it's final breaths in the early 1980s. He creatively brought skateboarding from parks and custom-made ramps to the streets. Even the shape of skateboards were changed from flat to curve at both ends because he invented ollies and curved skateboards made it easier to do it. </p><p>There is much more he did for skateboarding than people know. The contribution which I consider the greatest and most radical was that he gave a platform, a craft to pursue for future skateboarders. He gave skateboarding a rebirth, the skateboarding was now done on a totally different terrain. It was made possible by just an ollie! Ollie is when you push your backfoot such that the board jumps from the front while guiding the board with the frontfoot. With the invention of ollie skateboards could now jump over curbs and other barriers. Then for easier ollies and other variantions such as frontside shovit, backside shovit, kickflip, heelflip and other flips which didn't used ollie such as pop shovit and primo slides, skateboards with curved ends became the mainstream. Afterall this was the skateboard which introduced a complete new dimension to skateboarding, the street.</p>",

        "title": "MS#2 Building the website: Wireframing?",
        "content": "<p>I was trying to embed spotify player in memories. It's a great idea. I should play with spotify and last.fm apis, there could easily be some features I don't know about. Well, I looked through their apis, nothing interesting to use on this website.</p><p>Listen to this song...</p><div class=\"col-md-6 col-sm-12\"><iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A6ppPNxdwG8A5Ed8DlNLV6I\" width=\"100%\" height=\"80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe></div><p>I accidentally listened to this when Spotify played this after <em>Iron Maiden's</em> playlist finished. Fell in love the moment I heard it. Althought in my experience the songs that I like in the first listen are the songs which seem to fade away quickly. </p><p>Anyways, I am using tinyMCE&nbsp;editor. It's nice because it's producing the final HTML in minified format. I just need a way to automate this process. I should look into the features of this editor. Maybe there's a way to convert the HTML into JSON&nbsp;somehow. That would be so easy for me then. Will have to write extra code for user layer for login, that would require me to study MongoDB. Well, let's see how this goes.</p><p>I got an idea, some implementation of adding notes to memories. Although it would require me to manually add them in data.json file which will be tiresome. We will see about that. I have decided to leave data.json to be my primary and quite frankly the only way to update/add memories. I just need to figure out AWS. It's so fucking confusing. I configured it to run blue/green deployment but my server where not stopping, even when I terminated them manually, new servers kept popping up!</p><p>And this is the reason why you should plan your project properly before starting it. I don't have continous integration or any server to put this project on or the final wireframe of the project. When they say that you should wireframe your project first, I hope they know that most probably there will be major changes to the project in the future. I should have wireframed properly eitherways. Now I need to shift everything from base component to a new component of itself such that I can summon it anywhere in the base component as a part of the it. And similarly make new components as a child of the base component. If I had thought about this earlier then it would have saved much of my time now. So, I guess wireframing is important even though you will have to change most of it in the end.</p>",

        "content": "<p>What is it anyway? Giving a name to oneself on the basis of an act? The way I see it, a single person cannot be called a specific name and cannot be placed into a particular category. It's not this binary. \"Either you are or you're not\", it does not work this way. There's a whole spectrum where you can be placed depending on your indeulgence in the act, whatever it may be. But this contradicts my beliefs. If there is a spectrum and you are a part of it, doesn't matter how basic, even then you are entitled to it.</p><p>Now to think of it I guess my beliefs are contradicted when we take a physical job category. Like a man could be a programmer or not, it's binary. On the other hand if we talk about psychological titles, it's true that one cannot be a certain thing. Suppose calling a man a liar. he lies, but sometimes he speaks the truth and sometimes he lies for a cause. That cause could be defending a truth or  anyone's values, that cause could be futile, that cause could be valuable for the man ot that cause could be greed. And then there are multiple ways to interpret it. Some people would call it a lie, because a lie is a lie, some people would consider it a neccessary lie but then what would you call the man? A lying person or a honest one? The recursion goes on.</p><p>See, it's not binary. There shouldn't be this name-calling.</p>",

It may feel like a vague statement but when you look into it long and hard you will see that Earthlings consider very highly of themselves. They have forgotten where they came from. I consider human race nothing but a mere coincidence. It's literally a coincidence that a planet formed right in the habitable zone of one of the millions of star system in one of the galaxy among millions galaxies  when big-bang occured.</p><p>As they say, we are  a mere blip in cosmic universe time. We shouldn't consider ourselves more than that. Everyone should strive to survive nothing more than that. There should be no hate, no greed and no lies. But even survival of oneself would provoke hate and vengences due to our flawed judgement. I guess in order to even survive we first should strive to find peace. Living with one another in peace should be our goal. Taking only what's necessary and caring for one's brother should be the life humans should lead.</p><p>But all that is fantasy of the naive. The very nature of human is destructive. we can't live in <i>peace</i>? Our very nature us evil. Look at the state of the world right now. Terrorists being true humans while the other side getting off by pretending how good and important they are. Doing heroic acts just to be the center of attention while not even trying to solve this obvious and predictive state of affairs they call \"problem\". You see? This crave of self-importance which makes humans feel they should matter in this crowd of 7 Billion people, self-importance, yet another flaw deeply rooted in humans.</p><p>You may think I'm a cynical person and you are right, but I like to think that cynism is nothing but the truth we don't want to believe in.</p>",

Nothing works, I've tried doing several things to shake off this burnout but nothing works!</p><p>There is no good or bad. I'm neither good nor bad. Giving up on your passion should not be considered a downfall. There are reasons for giving up. I'm quantifying it in good and bad because after I stopped training I constantly gave in to weed. That made me think that I'm a bad person for trading the thing I loved the most for a drug. But it was not like that, I understand now. It was not weed that pulled me away from my passion. My passion was long dead. And in trying to revamp the fire(which was imaginary at that point of time), I lost to it everyday for an entire fucking year.</p><div class=\"col-md-6 col-sm-12\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/networkbooks.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/dunning-kruger-effect.jpg?resize=660%2C553\" alt=\"Confidence-Knowledge Graph\" width=\"100%\" /></div><p>And because I lost over and over again in trying to \"<em>get back on the wagon</em>\", it pushed me deeper and deeper into the<em> abyss</em> of<em> guilt</em>. Another problem surfaced-\"learned helplessness\".</p>\"Well if I'm not practicing and I pretty much don't like doing anything else then why not get high?\". Getting high is fun, yes! But what it really does is prolong the time when you have to confront the problem. And it doesn't even felt good, when you are so guilt ridden and you realize you passion fading away, all you will ever feel will be every-growing guilt and self-loathing. I got nothing against weed but you should not use it to numb the pain, because guess what? it doesn't . So, basically what it really is, is an excuse to convince yourself-\"Well, I'm high I can't code&nbsp;<em>now!&nbsp;</em>\".<p>But at the end of all this, I see a silver lining. Psychology has started to make sense to me. I understand it better, or it could be the symbol of the cradled over-confidence in me. I could be in that zone. Who knows?</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

You won't find influencial music <em>there?</em> The music that will guide you, inspire you, help you, challenge your mind with their clever lyrics and messages hidden between the lines, songs like these won't be present on <em>billboard.</em> Pop culture is death! It's one repetitive, brain-washing, uncreative and destructive genre of music.</p><p><em>\" Was I miserable that I listened to pop music or did listening to pop music made me miserable?\"</em> - Rob, High Fidelity.</p><p>I'm possessed by <em>Iron Maiden</em> well, you can basically say by the whole metal genre. Just found out that <em>Katatonia's</em> new album <em>Fall of the Hearts</em> is getting really good reviews. <p><img src=\"http://territorioinformativo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Katatonia-_Fall-Of-Hearts-Territorio-Informativo.jpg\" width=\"100%\"></p><p>I mean I knew it would be worth listening to but this unpreceedented appreciation for the album I'm seeing online is awesome. They are saying that <em>Katatonia</em> has changed their music style for the better. They are more of a progressive metal band. Now Katatonia is blending doom metal and progressive metal. I'm actually really psyched for this genre change, it's like they just <em>progressed</em> towards progressive metal. As I am writing this I feel such an urge to listen to it right now. I mean it's doom + progressive, how could someone knowingly wait for something like that? I am saving the album for the winter. I know that's childish and doing that sometimes turns out to be a bad idea but, it's <em>Katatonia</em>, I'am not going to listen it in the summer.<div class=\"col-md-6 col-sm-12\"><iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A5k6Ez0jYu35rQ5lq7LlEWQ\" width=\"100%\" height=\"80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe></div> When it's bleak outside and every thing is quite, still and cold that will be the time to play <em>Katatonia</em>. Or should I listen to it right now? It won't matter much, i will still be listening to it in the winter. Katatonia is capable enough to create that bleak atmosphere even on a sunny day. Just take <em>In the white</em> for a sample track. From the moment the song begins, right from the first beat the atmosphere around you changes into a bleaker, darker yet welcoming one. The guitars on the songs are just magnificient. This band is one of those bands who are good in every aspect. The guitar, the vocals, the lyrics, the style of delivery, the bass, the rythym and the drums.</p>",
